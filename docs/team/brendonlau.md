### Project: AddressBook Level 3

Tinner (Anagram of Intern) is a desktop app for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Tinner allows you to easily sort through and retrieve the relevant information faster than traditional GUI apps.
