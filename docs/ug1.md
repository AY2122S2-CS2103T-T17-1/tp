Tinner (Anagram of Intern) is a desktop app for managing internship applications for students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Tinner allows you to easily sort through and retrieve relevant information faster than traditional GUI apps.

Tinner aims to solve the hassle of managing internship applications though 3 aspects.
1. **Tracks** essential information such as statuses and deadlines at a glance.
2. **Reminds** important deadlines so that you will not miss a about your application.
3. **Reviews** the process and take down notes so that you can ace your next application.

## Features <a id="features"></a>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/COMPANY`, `COMPANY` is a parameter* which can be used as `add n/Google`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/COMPANY [p/PHONE_NUMBER]` can be used as `n/Google P/65427981` or as `n/Google`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/COMPANY [p/PHONE_NUMBER]`, `[p/PHONE_NUMBER] n/COMPANY` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

*Note: a parameter is the user input that is given to a command.
